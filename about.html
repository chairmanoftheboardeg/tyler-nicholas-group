            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              Tyler Nicholas Group began as a decision to treat online ventures with the same structure and attention
              as a traditional corporate group. Rather than operating separate projects in isolation, the vision was to
              create a unified digital holdings company with a clear name, identity, and long-term plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The early portfolio started with gaming, e-commerce, and foundation concepts. Today, TNG serves as the
              parent entity for current and future digital businesses that sit under the group umbrella.

              <h4>From Ideas to a Group</h4>
              <p>
                What began as separate ideas became a structured portfolio. Each initiative is now designed to align with
                a wider group strategy, not just exist on its own.

                TNG is operated with a corporate mindset from day one—governance, naming, and clarity of purpose are
                part of the foundation, not an afterthought.
